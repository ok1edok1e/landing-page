## Introduction
```

    Math is never just numbers. In the wrong hands, it's a weapon. In the right hands, deliverance.

    - Hari Seldon, Professor of Probability Theory at Streeling University

```

I present my **Second project** from **Foundation Course** for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. I chose the **Foundation series** as the theme for this **"Landing page"**, based on the award-winning novels by **Isaac Asimov**, **Foundation Chronicles**. By the will of the slush, the name of the series and the course coincided, although initially, I thought of taking the topic based on the **"John Wick 4"** series. 

<br>

## Goals

This project aimed to create a **"Landing page"** on any interesting topic using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` (optional). The site must contain a `header`, `footer`, and four content `sections`. 

<br>

## Process

I started with a blank `HTML` page, adding all the content elements. Then I added a `CSS` file for the styles. As I created the `sections`, I had to learn a lot of new information on CSS and delve a little deeper into JavaScript to create the `navigation bar`, `banner`, and `video`.
