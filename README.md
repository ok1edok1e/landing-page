## INTRODUCTION
```

      Math is never just numbers. In the wrong hands, it's a weapon. In the right hands, deliverance.

      HARI SELDON
      Professor of Probability Theory at Streeling University

```

I present my **Second project** from **Foundation Course** for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. I chose the **Foundation series** as the theme for this **"Landing page"**, based on the award-winning novels by **Isaac Asimov**, **Foundation Chronicles**. By the will of the slush, the name of the series and the course coincided, although initially, I thought of taking the topic based on the **"John Wick 4"** series.

## ASSIGNMENT

This project aimed to create a **"Landing page"** on any interesting topic using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` (optional). The site must contain a `header`, `footer`, and four content `sections`.  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">Link to source</a>

<br>

## DESIGN

### Wireframe

Before starting the project, a **Wireframe** was made to understand the general structure of `sections` and `elements`. This step helped clarify the **idea** and **hierarchy** of the `HTML` page.

<br>

### Styleguide

Also, to understand the visual style and states of `elements` on the page, a **Style guide** was created. This step helped simplify the creation of `variables` in `CSS`.

<br>

### Navigation

For quick navigation between `sections`, a **Navigation bar** was created. By clicking on each of these `links`, you can jump to the selected `section`. This element was developed using `JavaScript`.

<br>

### Banner

A **Banner** has also been added to offer promotions. This `element` was developed using `JavaScript`.

## CONCLUSION

While working on this "Landing page", I learned a lot of new information about `CSS` that was not covered in this course. I also had to learn a bit about `JavaScript` to implement some `elements` on the page.
The project helped me to test myself as a beginner **Frontend Developer** and to understand how a kitchen works from the inside. This has given me the strength and interest to continue my career as a **Full Stack Developer.**

This concept was developed based on the <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000" target="_blank">Apple TV</a> service page for the series of the same name.
